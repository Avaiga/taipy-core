    """Execution status of a `Submission^`.

    It is implemented as an enumeration.

    The possible values are:

    - `SUBMITTED`: A `SUBMITTED` submission has been submitted for execution but not processed yet by
        the orchestrator.

    - `UNDEFINED`: AN `UNDEFINED` submission's jobs have been submitted for execution but got some undefined
        status changes.

    - `PENDING`: A `PENDING` submission has been enqueued by the orchestrator. It is waiting for an executor
        to be available for its execution.

    - `BLOCKED`: A `BLOCKED` submission has been blocked because it has been finished with a job being blocked.

    - `RUNNING`: A `RUNNING` submission has its jobs currently being executed.

    - `CANCELED`: A `CANCELED` submission has been submitted but its execution has been canceled.

    - `FAILED`: A `FAILED` submission has a job failed during its execution.

    - `COMPLETED`: A `COMPLETED` submission has successfully been executed.
