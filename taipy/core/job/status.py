    It is implemented as an enumeration.
    
    The possible values are:

    - `SUBMITTED`: A `SUBMITTED` job has been submitted for execution but not processed yet by
        the scheduler.

    - `PENDING`: A `PENDING` job has been enqueued by the scheduler. It is waiting for an executor
        to be available for its execution.

    - `BLOCKED`: A `BLOCKED` job has been blocked because its input data nodes are not ready yet.
        It is typically waiting for another `Job^` to be completed.

    - `RUNNING`: A `RUNNING` job is currently executed by a dedicated executor.

    - `CANCELLED`: A `CANCELLED` job has been submitted but its execution has been cancelled.

    - `FAILED`: A `FAILED` job raised an exception during its execution.

    - `COMPLETED`: A `COMPLETED` job has successfully been executed.

    - `SKIPPED`: A `SKIPPED` job has not been executed because its outputs were already computed.
